					<div id="Div1">
						<p>A Character/Shot Report is nothing more than a form every player inside the family fills out on a weekly basis and in which they
							state their current status and progress.
							These forms are the means by which the managing structure of the family can get a detailed and concrete overview of every one
							of it's members. Enabling them to create a picture of the family as a whole, with all it's weaknesses and strengths well measured,
							while at the same time assess every individual as a part of the collective, and steer the direction of their progress in a manner
							which boosts the qualities and overcomes the flaws of the organization.
						</p>
						<p>As such, the scope of information asked for in these is generally related to your current primary skill-bases
							(Aim, Defense, Vision, Stealth, Physique) with an emphasys on your Aim, and the roles you undertake while inside your crew.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Note</strong>: Reports are for the most part a beaurocracy, but a very needed one. They shouldn't ever replace but instead
							complement the act of managing a family and all the resources it's members bring to the table. By themselves, they don't attest
							to more than the trustworthiness and engagement of the family members, but if well managed it can provide the means to create a solid
							and reliant organization. More so in a large-sized one.

						<div id="Div2">
							<p><strong>The importance</strong> of timely and accurate reports couldn't ever be understated.
								The "<i>vagueness</i>" on which MR is founded upon leaves alot of open space for the players to fill in	with interaction and
								creativity, but which at the same time can create alot of distance between the factual current state of the game, and the one which
								is merely perceivable and thus very prone to miss-calculation. Precision of assessment then becomes a highly valuable resource.
							</p>
							<p>In the game of guesses, a family which doesn't know itself is not yet ready to suppose other families.
								And even if the reports are not the main tool for a good organization, these are still the front-line of clear and unfiltered
								interaction between the	upper structure of a family and all of it's membership.
								So <u>filling out a report that is misleading or untruthful</u> will denote a lack of trust on your behalf towards your family, and this
								is considered a great offense. One which is easilly perceived and usually leads to big consequences.
							</p>
							<p><strong>DO NOTE:</strong> After having explained, in the briefest I am capable of, as to how and why the reports are
								important. I wouldn't think it would be required to let you know how restricted the access to their results
								actually is, but for the sake of clear speech and understanding I will.
								The information given in a report, is not accessible if not for core upper structure members (CLs/HSLs) of the family,
								and the repository on which	this information is deposited doesn't allow copying from.

								In this section you're asked for just the basic information about your character so that the upcoming values you're about to
								fill in can be identified with... Well, you. Obviously you put your <strong>Name</strong> in this section, and sometimes reports
								ask for any combination of <strong>Rank</strong>, <strong>Crew</strong>, <strong>District/City</strong>, and pretty much any
								other value which can be found in your <a href="https://mafiareturns.com/news/uprofile.php?id=0">public profile</a>.
								These last ones are generally for organization and mapping purposes at a quick glance.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								<strong>GMT</strong> may also be asked as an <u>optional</u>. Nobody is really interested in where you live, timezones don't
								give off that information either, as each one is usually shared with a group of countries that go from the northern to the southern
								hemisphere of the planet. It's just that it may be better to pair you into a crew/team of players who are closer to your timezone,
								or even when creating any sort of event/operation, it may help to know which players we're most likely to invite and coordinate
								with if we know it's in a "healthy" time for them.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div style="display: none" id="BGs">
							<p align="justify">
								Here is where you'll tell us about two very important values: Bodyguard <strong>Total</strong> and <strong>Effective</strong>
								(<i>Equivalent</i>).
								Which you can find at the bottom of your <a href="https://mafiareturns.com/manage/bgmanagement.php">Bodyguard Management Page</a>.
								Total is just the sum of all bodyguards you currently have employed, whereas the equivalent is all of your BG's summed Health Points
								divided by 100 (every 100hp gives you 1 defense point).
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								These two values are the front-line of a crew's defenses and from time to time, adjustments to these may be made on an individual
								level in order to attain a desired standard inside the crew. Part of the treasury is generally dedicated to providing the crew with
								the means to have a good defense across the board.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div style="display: none" id="Skills">
							<p align="justify">
								There are four Skills which are usually covered in this place: <strong>Vision</strong> (<i>Street Smarts</i>),
								<strong>Stealth</strong>, <strong>Defense</strong> and <strong>Physique</strong>. They are the means with which Characters
								interact with eachother from a purely game-mechanic point of view, and are thus very important when assigning the roles anyone
								can have while in a crew or operation.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								There is more than one way to ascertain your current skill-base values, as there is also more than one way to have one's skills
								being initially set:<br>
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								If you started your character on a <strong>Roll</strong>, meaning that you rolled your character's skills to random yet precise
								values, as opposed to answering a set of questions, then you already have all of them
								available to you on your <a href="https://mafiareturns.com/manage/profile.php">Profile Management Page</a>.
								Scroll down until you find your "<i>Initial Roll</i>", and to those, add the
								<a href="https://mafiareturns.com/manage/hustle_spend.php">Hustle</a> increments you've made to each skill and you'll have
								your current skill-base.<br>
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								If you started by answering a <strong>Set of Questions</strong>, you'll also find those on your Profile Page,
								under "<i>Startup RP Answers</i>". Certain sets are equivalent to certain 100% specializations in the following manner:<br>
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: center">
								<strong>14534353</strong> - 100% Vision<br>
								<strong>13421431</strong> - 100% Stealth<br>
								<strong>32412114</strong> - 100% Aim<br>
								<strong>11131141</strong> - 100% Defense<br>
								<br>
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								<u>You only have to input your Hustles on the report if you started on any of the 4 previous Answer Sets.</u><br>
								If you started on a different Answer Set however, consider talking with your CL to ascertain your current skill-base for now.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div style="display: none" id="Shots">
							<p align="justify">
								Due to it's critical nature, your Aim (<i>Wack</i>) skill is not directly asked for in the report. Instead, only the values which are
								required for calculating the skill are to be input, and from those the result is ascertained and stored internally.
								These consist on the total of <strong>Player Bodyguard Damages</strong>,
								<strong>NPC Bodyguard Damages</strong>, <strong>Character Kills</strong>, <strong>Shooting Ranges</strong>, <strong>Hustles</strong>,
								<strong>Holyday Bonuses</strong> or pretty much any other gun-skill incrementing activity you have made on your character.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
								All of these values can be found in your <a href="https://mafiareturns.com/news/personals.php">Personals Page</a>. But it is
								a good practice to keep track of them on a separate file (<i>usually on an online platform like a GoogleDrive Sheet or a OneDrive
								Excel Workbook</i>).
